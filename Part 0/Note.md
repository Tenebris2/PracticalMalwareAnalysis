## The Goals Of Malware Analysis

- The purpose is to provide the information you need to respond to a network intrusion. To determine what happened, and to ensure that youve located all infected machines and files.
- When analyzing suspected malware, the goal is to determine what exactly what a particular suspect binary can do, how to detect it, how to measure and contain its damage.

### Host-based Signatures

- Used for detecting malicious code on the victim computers.

### Network Sigatures

- Used to detect malicious code via network traffic.
  
## Malware Analysis Techniques

### Basic Static Analysis

- Straightforward and quick though is quite inefficient versus sophisticated malware, and it can miss important behaviors.

### Dynamic Static Analysis

- It can be used to run the malware and observe it's behavior on the system in order to remove the infection, produce effective signatures or both.

### Advanced Static Analysis

- Reverse Engineering the malware's internals by loading the executable into a disassembler and looking at the programs instructions in order to discover what the program does.

### Advanced Dynamic Analysis

- Using a debugger to examine the internal state of a running malicious executable.
  
### **Types of Malware**

- **Backdoor** : Malicious code that creates a backdoor for the attacker to infiltrate the computer requiring no additional authentication.
- **Botnet** : Used to allow attackers to access the computer, but all computers infected with the same botnet receive the same instructions from a single command-and-control server
- **Downloader** : Used to download more malware.
- **Worm** : Multiplie and infect additional computers.
- **Launcher** : Used to launch malware.
- **Rootkit** : Created to hide code, usually paired with other malware such as backdoor.

### Rules for Malware Analysis

- Focus on the key features.
- Different tools and approaches are available for different jobs.
- Respond to changes in the war against malware
