# Chapter 1 : Basic Analysis

## Basic Static Techniques

### Hashing

Examples include the Message-Digest-Algorithm 5 (MD5) hash function, the Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA - 1).
  
### Strings

### Packed and Obfuscated Malware

### Portable Executable File Format

### Libraries and Functions

Important that we gather the list of functions that it imports. It is critical to our understand of the malware.

#### Static, Runtime and Dynamic Linking

- **Static Linking** : the least commonly used method of linking libraries as it copies the library's code into the executable thereby increasing the size. Though this come as an advantage as when analyzing code, it becomes difficult to differentiate between statically linked code and the executable's own code.
- **Runtime Linking** : Though unpopular in friendly programs, runtime linking is commonly used for packed, obfuscated malware. Runtime Linking connects to libraries only when the function is needed and not at program start as with dynamically linked programs.
- **Dynamic Linking** : Most common and the most interesting for malware analysts. When libraries are dynamically linked, the host OS searches for the necessary libraries when the program is loaded, and all is stored in the PE file header, information about every library that will be loaded and every function that will be used in the program.

#### Sections of a PE File

- **.text** : Contains the executable code.
- **.rdata** : Holds read-only data that is globally accessible.
- **.data** : Stores global data.
- **.idata** : If present, it stores information about import functions. Else the import functions are stored in .rdata section.
- **.edata** : If present, it stores information about export functions. Else the export functions are stored in .rdata section.
- **.pdata** : Present only in 64-bit executables and stores exception-handling information.
- **.rsrc** : Stores resources needed by the executable.
- **.reloc** : Contains information for relocation of library files.
